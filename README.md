# Pathfinding Visualizer

A Python-based pathfinding visualizer built with Pygame, showcasing various pathfinding algorithms including A*, Dijkstra's algorithm, Depth-First Search (DFS), Breadth-First Search (BFS), and Uniform Cost Search (UCS). This project allows users to interactively visualize how different algorithms navigate a grid with obstacles.

## Features

- **Interactive Grid**: Click to set start and end points, as well as barriers.
- **Multiple Algorithms**: Choose from A*, Dijkstra, DFS, BFS, and UCS.
- **Path Visualization**: Watch how each algorithm finds a path to the destination.
- **Clear Functionality**: Reset the grid with a simple button click.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed on your system. Pygame is required for this project:

```bash
pip install pygame
